CyberNexus: An All-in-One Cyber Security Toolkit
Project Overview

CyberNexus is a comprehensive, client-side web application designed to empower individuals and small businesses to improve their personal and professional cybersecurity posture. Built as a single-page, browser-based tool, it combines two essential functions: a Cyber Hygiene Checkup and a secure file encryption utility called CryptoVault. The entire application operates locally on the user's device, ensuring that no sensitive data, files, or passwords are ever transmitted to a server. This design prioritizes user privacy and security above all else.

Key Features

Cyber Hygiene Checkup:

Purpose: Provides a structured checklist for assessing and improving an individual's or organization's digital security habits.

Functionality: Users answer a series of questions about their password practices, device updates, data backups, and online behavior.

Output: The tool instantly calculates a score, provides a color-coded security rating (e.g., "Good," "Fair," "At Risk"), and generates a list of actionable recommendations based on the user's responses. The report can be copied or downloaded for record-keeping.

CryptoVault:

Purpose: Offers a robust, local-only solution for encrypting and decrypting files of any type.

Functionality: Utilizing a strong cryptographic algorithm (AES-GCM), users can select a file, enter a password, and securely encrypt it. The resulting .crypt file can then be stored or shared, and only the correct password can decrypt it back to its original state.

Security: The entire encryption/decryption process is performed within the user's browser, guaranteeing that files and passwords never leave the local device.

Target Audience

Individuals: Seeking a user-friendly tool to enhance their personal online safety.

Small Business Owners: Needing a simple way to perform regular security audits and protect sensitive company data without relying on complex, costly software.

Cybersecurity Consultants: Looking for a clean, portable tool to use with clients during initial assessments and to demonstrate best practices.

Technology & Implementation

CyberNexus is a self-contained HTML file. It leverages modern web technologies including JavaScript for logic, the Web Cryptography API for secure encryption, and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and professional user interface. Its single-file nature makes it highly portable and easy to distribute.
